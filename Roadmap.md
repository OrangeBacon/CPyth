# Roadmap
1. [x] Implement top bar menu
2. [x] Add codemiror editor
3. [x] Add working console
4. [x] Add Jszip and working file system
5. [x] Add tab system above codemirror to change between different files.  Tabs will load the file into the existing codemirror rather than cycling through multiple, to try and reduce lag. When you change tab a box should come up to allow you to save or not before changing tab.  If saved the changes should then be added to the zip file.
6. [ ] Re-factor interpreter code to run in loop (````setInterval()````) to allow for easy adding of input methods
7. [x] Create button bar beneath codemirror for viewing file system and adding/deleting/remaining/moving files
8. [ ] Add interpretation of other languages
9. [ ] Add up arrow history to the input box, like in Webkit's Js console
10. [ ] Create drag-able dialogue box API for file addition, saving etc. 
11. [x] Create drag-able window API for adding  HTML pages into the page, E.G. Tutorial
